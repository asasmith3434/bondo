Syllabus and Video essay
</h1>
<body>
Mayuko, the software engineer in the video, mentions two similarities to concepts listed on the syllabus:
<ul> <li> Working with partners (soft skills) </li> <li> Basic language to communicate </li> 
There is a misconception when working in a software job field that engineers or ect. do not work together, however, 
most of the time people will work together. Group talks help teamwork and ideas circulate, or productivity increases.
On the syllabus, it's listed that there will be a lot of group or partner projects which go along with Mayuko's statement that 
group thought is one of the most important factors when in the work environment. Soft skills are heavily stressed by Mayuko; therefore, many of the
activities listed on the syllasbus involve the idea of working on communication skills with others. Futhermore, Mayuko stated that a base language was needed for most 
people working in the computer science field would need in order to communicate. In the syllabus it's stated that the  
fundamentals of languages would be introduced. There cleary is a similarity between some of the discussed topics in the video
and the foundation of the class listed in the syllabus. Maybe for future reference the syllabus or for the class there could be systamatic
examination, where people are assigned to over look each others works for corrections. This would increase the examiners skills to 
recognize differences in works and mistakes, furthermore, people could recieve more help.
